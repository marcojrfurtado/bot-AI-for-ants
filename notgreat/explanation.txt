The biggest trick for my bot is to use a brute force algorithm for fighting in small battles. That jumped my rank from ~600 to where I am now. I use diffusion for exploration, food gathering, and reinforcement. Both that and my large scale battle algorithm could use some more fine tuning. I only use a single diffusion grid, and face major problems with ants all chasing after the same food. I had some ideas for fixing it, but decided to put a 1-day lockdown on code changes that weren't critical bugs (such as my ants suciding into each other trying to get onto an enemy's hill...)
